# CtCi data structures and problem solutions

This repository contains my own implementation of data structures and solutions to the problems presented in the well-known book *Cracking the Coding Interview*, as well as automated tests for all of them.

## Big O

Each solution has a comment above it indicating its time and space complexity respectively. If it's marked with a `*`, it means that the solution I came up was not optimal. Please refer to the book for more optimal solutions to those problems.
